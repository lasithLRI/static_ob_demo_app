/**
 * A standard application layout component that establishes a persistent **header**
 * and a main content area for rendering child components.
 *
 * It consumes the **`ConfigContext`** and passes the entire context object to the **`<Header />`**
 * component, enabling the header to dynamically render application details (like the name).
 * The main content is rendered within the `product-content-outer` div using the **`children`** prop.
 *
 * @param {object} props - The component props.
 * @param {React.ReactNode} props.children - The content (views or components) to be displayed in the main body of the application.
 * @returns {JSX.Element} The rendered application shell with a header and content area.
