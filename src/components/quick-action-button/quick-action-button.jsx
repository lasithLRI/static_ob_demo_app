/**
 * A reusable, styled button component optimized for display within quick action lists.
 *
 * It uses the **Oxygen UI `IconButton`** component for its base structure and wraps the content
 * with the **`ActionButtonContentOuter`** styled component to define the custom layout.
 * The component expects the **`children`** prop to be an array containing exactly two elements,
 * which are destructured into:
 * 1. The **icon** element (`iconElement`).
 * 2. The **text label** element (`nameText`).
 *
 * Note: The `onClick` prop has been removed from the component signature, as the functionality
 * is now inherited by the underlying `IconButton` (assuming the `IconButton` handles the click).
 *
 * @param {object} props - The component props.
 * @param {Array<React.ReactNode>} props.children - An array where the first element is the icon component and the second is the name text/label.
 * @returns {JSX.Element} The rendered quick action button.
